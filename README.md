# CS255-System-Analysis-Design-Portfolio


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, is a driving school that helps students pass their drivers license exam.  They wanted to create an online Learning Management System to help their students review course materials, take practice tests, and schedule one-on-one driving time with an isntructor.
    
    What did you do particularly well?

I think I balanced creating diagrams that captured the required functionality of the system while also keeping them simple enough to read.  Another benefit of this simplified design is that the diagrams don't become prescriptive, which keeps the project Agile.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
I would likely redo the client presentation.  It could be reworked to be more detailed and have more salient talking points for decision makers.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs by breaking them into individual stories.  Each story was then broken into its prerequisite parts and built into the system design.  For example, a story might be "As a student, I want to enter my username and password so that I can login to the system."  This story is then broken into its system design components, like having a database to store usernames and passwords, security and performance checks, data flow diagrams, etc.  Keeping a project aligned to the users needs increases the value of a product and reduces the cost associated with refactoring code that doesn't meet requirements.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I chose to use the MVC design pattern for the system because I was familiar with and thought it would be modular enough to make the system extensible and maintainable.  In the future, I would use data flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and structural diagrams to better understand the clients needs and system interactions.
